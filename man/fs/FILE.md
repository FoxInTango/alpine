              ues.  The length modifier for intptr_t for the scanf(3) family of functions is expanded by the macros SCNdPTR and SCNiPTR, (defined in <inttypes.h>);  resulting  commonly  in  %"SCNdPTR"  or  %"SCNiPTR"  for  scanning
              intptr_t values.

              Used for a count of bytes.  It is the result of the sizeof operator.  According to the C language standard, it shall be an unsigned integer type capable of storing values in the  range  [0,  SIZE_MAX].   According  to
              POSIX, the implementation shall support one or more programming environments where the width of size_t is no greater than the width of the type long.

              The length modifier for size_t for the printf(3) and the scanf(3) families of functions is z; resulting commonly in %zu or %zx for printing size_t values.

              Versions: <aio.h>, <glob.h>, <grp.h>, <iconv.h>, <mqueue.h>, <pwd.h>, <signal.h>, and <sys/socket.h> define size_t since POSIX.1-2008.

              Used  for  a  count  of bytes or an error indication.  According to POSIX, it shall be a signed integer type capable of storing values at least in the range [-1, SSIZE_MAX], and the implementation shall support one or
              more programming environments where the width of ssize_t is no greater than the width of the type long.

              Glibc and most other implementations provide a length modifier for ssize_t for the printf(3) and the scanf(3) families of functions, which is z; resulting commonly in %zd or %zi for printing ssize_t values.   Although
              z works for ssize_t on most implementations, portable POSIX programs should avoid using it—for example, by converting the value to intmax_t and using its length modifier (j).

       uintmax_t
              Include: <stdint.h>.  Alternatively, <inttypes.h>.

              An unsigned integer type capable of representing any value of any unsigned integer type supported by the implementation.  According to the C language standard, it shall be capable of storing values in  the  range  [0,
              UINTMAX_MAX].

              The macro UINTMAX_C() expands its argument to an integer constant of type uintmax_t.

              The length modifier for uintmax_t for the printf(3) and the scanf(3) families of functions is j; resulting commonly in %ju or %jx for printing uintmax_t values.

              Conforming to: C99 and later; POSIX.1-2001 and later.

              Bugs: uintmax_t is not large enough to represent values of type unsigned __int128 in implementations where unsigned __int128 is defined and unsigned long long is less than 128 bits wide.

              uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t

              An  unsigned  integer  type of a fixed width of exactly N bits, N being the value specified in its type name.  According to the C language standard, they shall be capable of storing values in the range [0, UINTN_MAX],
              substituting N by the appropriate number.

              According to POSIX, uint8_t, uint16_t, and uint32_t are required; uint64_t is only required in implementations that provide integer types with width 64; and all other types of this form are optional.

              The length modifiers for the uintN_t types for the printf(3) family of functions are expanded by macros of the forms PRIuN, PRIoN, PRIxN, and PRIXN (defined in <inttypes.h>); resulting  for  example  in  %"PRIu32"  or
              %"PRIx32"  for  printing  uint32_t values.  The length modifiers for the uintN_t types for the scanf(3) family of functions are expanded by macros of the forms SCNuN, SCNoN, SCNxN, and SCNXN (defined in <inttypes.h>);
              resulting for example in %"SCNu16" or %"SCNx16" for scanning uint16_t values.

       uintptr_t
              Include: <stdint.h>.  Alternatively, <inttypes.h>.

              An unsigned integer type such that any valid (void *) value can be converted to this type and back.  According to the C language standard, it shall be capable of storing values in the range [0, UINTPTR_MAX].

              The length modifier for uintptr_t for the printf(3) family of functions is expanded by the macros PRIuPTR, PRIoPTR, PRIxPTR, and PRIXPTR (defined in <inttypes.h>); resulting commonly in %"PRIuPTR"  or  %"PRIxPTR"  for
              printing  uintptr_t  values.   The  length  modifier for uintptr_t for the scanf(3) family of functions is expanded by the macros SCNuPTR, SCNoPTR, SCNxPTR, and SCNXPTR (defined in <inttypes.h>); resulting commonly in
              %"SCNuPTR" or %"SCNxPTR" for scanning uintptr_t values.

       va_list
              Include: <stdarg>.  Alternatively, <stdio.h>, or <wchar.h>.

              Used by functions with a varying number of arguments of varying types.  The function must declare an object of type va_list which is used by the macros va_start(3), va_arg(3), va_copy(3), and va_end(3) to traverse the
              list of arguments.

       void *
              According  to  the  C  language  standard,  a pointer to any object type may be converted to a pointer to void and back.  POSIX further requires that any pointer, including pointers to functions, may be converted to a
              pointer to void and back.

              Conversions from and to any other pointer type are done implicitly, not requiring casts at all.  Note that this feature prevents any kind of type checking: the programmer should be careful not  to  convert  a  void  *
              value to a type incompatible to that of the underlying data, because that would result in undefined behavior.

              This type is useful in function parameters and return value to allow passing values of any type.  The function will typically use some mechanism to know the real type of the data being passed via a pointer to void.

              A value of this type can't be dereferenced, as it would give a value of type void, which is not possible.  Likewise, pointer arithmetic is not possible with this type.  However, in GNU C, pointer arithmetic is allowed
              as an extension to the standard; this is done by treating the size of a void or of a function as 1.  A consequence of this is that sizeof is also allowed on void and on function types, and returns 1.

              The conversion specifier for void * for the printf(3) and the scanf(3) families of functions is p.

              Versions: The POSIX requirement about compatibility between void * and function pointers was added in POSIX.1-2008 Technical Corrigendum 1 (2013).

NOTES
       The structures described in this manual page shall contain, at least, the members shown in their definition, in no particular order.

       Most of the integer types described in this page don't have a corresponding length modifier for the printf(3) and the scanf(3) families of functions.  To print a value of an integer type that doesn't have a length  modifier,
       it should be converted to intmax_t or uintmax_t by an explicit cast.  To scan into a variable of an integer type that doesn't have a length modifier, an intermediate temporary variable of type intmax_t or uintmax_t should be
       used.  When copying from the temporary variable to the destination variable, the value could overflow.  If the type has upper and lower limits, the user should check that the value is within  those  limits,  before  actually
       copying the value.  The example below shows how these conversions should be done.

   Conventions used in this page
       In  "Conforming to" we only concern ourselves with C99 and later and POSIX.1-2001 and later.  Some types may be specified in earlier versions of one of these standards, but in the interests of simplicity we omit details from
       earlier standards.

       In "Include", we first note the "primary" header(s) that define the type according to either the C or POSIX.1 standards.  Under "Alternatively", we note additional headers that the standards specify shall define the type.

EXAMPLES
       The program shown below scans from a string and prints a value stored in a variable of an integer type that doesn't have a length modifier.  The appropriate conversions from and to intmax_t, and the appropriate range checks,
       are used as explained in the notes section above.

       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>

       int
       main (void)
       {
           static const char *const str = "500000 us in half a second";
           suseconds_t us;
           intmax_t    tmp;

           /* Scan the number from the string into the temporary variable */

           sscanf(str, "%jd", &tmp);

           /* Check that the value is within the valid range of suseconds_t */

           if (tmp < -1 || tmp > 1000000) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Scanned value outside valid range!\n");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           /* Copy the value to the suseconds_t variable 'us' */

           us = tmp;

           /* Even though suseconds_t can hold the value -1, this isn't
              a sensible number of microseconds */

           if (us < 0) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Scanned value shouldn't be negative!\n");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           /* Print the value */

           printf("There are %jd microseconds in half a second.\n",
                   (intmax_t) us);
